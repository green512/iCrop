# iCrop

A first large, public, multiclass road view crop photo dataset named iCrop was established for the development of crop type detection with deep learning.
Photos were divided into twelve types types, representing the dominate crop types or farmland without crop, including cotton,
maize, peanut, rape, rice, sorghum, soybean, sunflower, tobacco, vegetable, and wheat.
